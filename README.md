CommuniRaytor
The CommuniRaytor is a device that should help communication via Twitch Chat to Ray. 

FIrst of all it needs a Wifi connection, if its correctly setup it will connect automatically. If not, see the Wifi connection chapter. Once connected to the wifi, the device will connect to the Twitch chat, it will not be able to send messages, it will however read all the messages in the chat. It will show a message saying ‘CommuniRaytor activated!’


If a message in chat contains the phrase ‘!CR’ it will check if it was send by a moderator or the broadcaster, If this is the case it will blink the screen a few times (this means the screen goes fully white, and fully black) to draw attention to a new incoming message. 
It will then show name of the mod who send the message in all caps and between <>’s. And following it will show their message. 

If a !CR command is send and the word clear is in the message it will clear the screen so no message is shown.

The last message read is always the one that is shown. It will always show the last one.
 

Wifi connection
At startup, if the unit is not able to connect to its current Wifi-setting the screen will say ‘Attempting to connect to Wifi’. Normally this message should go by very fast. If you see the message for longer than a few seconds it means something is wrong. If the problem is the Wifi signal not being up (for instance you powered up the CommuniRaytor without having your hotspot active) just restart it, either by unplugging its power for two seconds or by pressing the reset button on the side around the top left corner of the display.
If you want to change the Wifi it is trying to connect see chapter ‘Wifi Setup’.
Wifi Setup
If it cant connect to Wifi, either cause the signal is not there or the password its trying to use is incorrect, it will go into Setup-mode. You can set the Wifi-settings up via a laptop or a phone. It will start its own Wifi-channel called ‘Connecting_Ray’, you can connect with this using “RayRulez123.” as the password.  

Once you are connected to its Wifi it should take you to its web-interface automatically. If it does not you can just copy paste http://192.168.4.1/ into your browser and go to that address. On this page just click ‘Configure Wifi’ connect to the wifi you want to connect to, which should be quite self explanatory. Either set the SSID (networkname) and password manually or just click on the network name you want to connect to and fill in the correct password for that network. It should then connect to the wifi.
